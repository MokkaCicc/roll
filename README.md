# Roll

`roll` is a python cmlet used to simulate some dices. It needs a single argument: the dice formula.

## Installation
Add `roll.py` to your system path, do not forget to install Python.

## Exemples
- `roll d6` -> roll a single 6 faced dice
- `roll 3d20` -> roll three 20 faced dices
- `roll 2d8+2` -> roll two 8 faced dices and add 2 to the total
- `roll 4f` -> roll four fudge dices

## Additionnal flags
The cmlet support the `-h` flag to show additionnal features.

## Future features
- chaining of multiple dices -> `roll 3d20+2d8-3`
- full testing suite
